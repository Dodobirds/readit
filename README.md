This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some things I've neglected...
- I'm pretty sure guest is broken for everything, don't post without signing in
- Should limit posts to top 10 or something, right now it will load every post in the db
- I hate styling css :/
- I did not really embrace a stateless design, so the react gets uglier as time went on
- upvote/downvote is closer to the medium clap system lets just say

## Its called readit but its not actually readit

I'm aware I haven't done anything to deal with conflicting emails from different account sources
as of init commit, home doesn't do anything, account proves that you are logged in
